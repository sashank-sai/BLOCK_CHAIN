# BLOCK_CHAIN
This is a basic implementation of the blockchain using javascript language. I have used postman and redis to run the program using different ports.The different ports acts as nodes and the final block chain will have all the data (which should be given from postman software) in a immutable chain with a hex value created using sha256 algorithm. This also creates nonce and adjust the difficulty according to the speed of reaching below the target given.
finally this acts as a backend for a fully functionable basic block chain.
Thanks to codeeater channel for teaching me to do the project.
